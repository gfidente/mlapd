About:
------

MLAPD is a Mailing List manager which works as a Postfix Policy Access Delegation deamon and uses LDAP to control lists access. It's written in Python.
The integration of MLAPD in your mail environment should simple enough if you know how the Postfix APD protocol works, anyway you can find useful the documentation at:

Requirments:
------------

* Python ( >= 2.4 )
* Python-LDAP ( >= 2.2.0 )

Postfix and LDAP are not needed on the same server machine where you are going to install MLAPD, but they have to be reached by MLAPD to make it working!
